# Idea of this tool is to try to bypass forbidden files, which are given by the user.
# The files given by the user should only be a couple of common forbidden files found on the target, which are then tried on all 200|404 pages.
# We will then take the first 401|403 result of the above scan, and place it to a list of forbidden endpoints i.e. format: list = [{"example.com":"/admin"}].
# After we've gathered all of the forbidden endpoints, we will start bypassing the file, using various techniques.
